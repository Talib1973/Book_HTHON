# Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics

Welcome to the comprehensive textbook for building intelligent robots that bridge digital AI with physical embodiment.

## Course Overview

This 13-week course covers the complete robotics stack from foundational middleware (ROS 2) to cutting-edge Vision-Language-Action (VLA) architectures. You'll learn to:

- Build modular robot software using ROS 2 Humble
- Create realistic digital twins with Gazebo and Unity
- Leverage GPU-accelerated simulation with NVIDIA Isaac Sim
- Implement Vision-Language-Action models for robotic control

## Prerequisites

### Required Knowledge
- **Python Programming**: Intermediate level (functions, classes, async)
- **Linux Command Line**: Basic navigation, file operations
- **Git Version Control**: Clone, commit, push
- **Mathematics**: Linear algebra (vectors, matrices), basic calculus

### Software/Hardware
- **Operating System**: Ubuntu 22.04 LTS (native or WSL2) OR cloud access to ROS 2 environment
- **ROS 2**: Humble Hawksbill (LTS) - [Installation Guide](https://docs.ros.org/en/humble/Installation.html)
- **Python**: 3.10+ with pip
- **Development Tools**: VS Code or PyCharm, Git
- **Optional**: NVIDIA GPU (for Isaac Sim local deployment)

### Recommended Background
- Exposure to robotics concepts (sensors, actuators, kinematics)
- Familiarity with machine learning frameworks (PyTorch or TensorFlow)
- Understanding of computer vision basics

## Course Structure

### Module 1: The Robotic Nervous System (ROS 2)
**Weeks 3-5** - Learn ROS 2 architecture, publisher-subscriber patterns, and service-action communication.

### Module 2: Digital Twin (Gazebo & Unity)
**Weeks 6-7** - Build physics-based simulations for testing robot behaviors before hardware deployment.

### Module 3: NVIDIA Isaac Sim
**Weeks 8-10** - Leverage GPU-accelerated simulation and synthetic data generation for AI training.

### Module 4: Vision-Language-Action (VLA)
**Weeks 11-13** - Implement state-of-the-art VLA models (RT-1, RT-2, PaLM-E) for robotic manipulation.

### Capstone Project
**Week 14** - Integrate all modules to build an end-to-end humanoid robotics system.
