# Module 2: Digital Twin (Gazebo & Unity)

## Overview

Digital twins enable safe, cost-effective robot development by simulating physics-based environments before deploying to hardware. This module covers Gazebo Sim (physics-based simulation) and Unity ML-Agents (reinforcement learning environments).

## What You'll Learn

### Week 6: Gazebo Simulation
- Build URDF robot models
- Simulate sensors (LIDAR, cameras, IMU)
- Integrate Gazebo with ROS 2

### Week 7: Unity ML-Agents
- Create RL training environments
- Implement reward functions
- Train policies for manipulation tasks

## Learning Objectives

1. Model robots using URDF/SDF formats
2. Simulate realistic physics with Gazebo
3. Integrate simulated sensors with ROS 2
4. Build reinforcement learning environments in Unity
5. Train robot policies before hardware deployment
