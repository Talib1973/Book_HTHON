# Module 1: The Robotic Nervous System (ROS 2)

## Overview

ROS 2 (Robot Operating System 2) is the foundational middleware that powers modern robotics. Just as the nervous system coordinates communication between different parts of the human body, ROS 2 enables modular robot components (sensors, actuators, planners) to communicate seamlessly.

## What You'll Learn

### Week 3: ROS 2 Architecture
- Understand nodes, topics, services, and actions
- Learn the DDS middleware layer
- Build your first ROS 2 node

### Week 4: Publisher-Subscriber Pattern
- Implement pub-sub for sensor data streaming
- Master topic communication
- Handle message types and custom messages

### Week 5: Services and Actions
- Use request-reply patterns for robot control
- Implement long-running tasks with actions
- Build service clients and servers

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this module, you will be able to:

1. Design modular robot architectures using ROS 2 nodes
2. Implement publisher-subscriber patterns for real-time sensor data
3. Use services for synchronous robot commands
4. Implement actions for long-running tasks with feedback
5. Debug ROS 2 systems using command-line tools

## Prerequisites

- Python 3.10+ programming
- Ubuntu 22.04 LTS (or WSL2)
- ROS 2 Humble installed ([Installation Guide](https://docs.ros.org/en/humble/Installation.html))
- Basic understanding of distributed systems

## Tools and Technologies

- **ROS 2 Humble Hawksbill**: Latest LTS release
- **Python rclpy**: ROS 2 Python client library
- **ros2cli**: Command-line tools for debugging
- **Colcon**: ROS 2 build tool

## Key Concepts

- **Nodes**: Independent processes that perform computation
- **Topics**: Named buses for asynchronous message passing
- **Services**: Request-reply communication for synchronous operations
- **Actions**: Long-running tasks with feedback and cancellation
- **Parameters**: Node configuration values
- **Launch Files**: Orchestrate multiple nodes
