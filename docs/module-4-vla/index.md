# Module 4: Vision-Language-Action (VLA)

## Overview

Vision-Language-Action models represent the cutting edge of robotic AI, enabling robots to understand natural language instructions, perceive visual scenes, and execute complex manipulation tasks.

## What You'll Learn

### Week 11: Foundation Models for Robotics
- Understand VLA architecture (RT-1, RT-2)
- Integrate vision encoders with language models
- Map language to robotic actions

### Week 12: PaLM-E and Multimodal Reasoning
- Combine PaLM language model with robot embodiment
- Implement chain-of-thought reasoning for tasks
- Handle multi-step manipulation scenarios

### Week 13: Conversational Robotics
- Integrate Whisper for speech recognition
- Use LLMs for task planning
- Deploy conversational AI on robots

## Learning Objectives

1. Implement Vision-Language-Action models for robotic control
2. Fine-tune foundation models for manipulation tasks
3. Integrate speech recognition and language models
4. Deploy VLA systems on ROS 2 hardware
